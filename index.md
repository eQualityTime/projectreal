Welcome to #Project Real.  This project has been co created by young people, teachers, influencers and academics. It aims to give young people the skills to be critical consumers of information they find online and to feel confident in their abilities to make good decisions based on this. 

Fake news reaches more people and spreads more quickly than the truth (Science, 2018) and is believed around 75% of the time (Silveman & Singer-Vine, 2016), meaning millions of people may have been fooled by fake news (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017). It is vital to help people to develop skills to recognise fake news as they are our first line of defence against fake news.  

There are 6 lesson plans designed for learners aged around 11-13.  There is a short guide and a set of slides which educators can use to take young people through activities and discussions to help them to recognise and challenge fake news.  We have made explicit links to the curriculum to help embed this project into the wider school context.  The lessons have been created collaboratively between young people, teachers, influencers and academics and are designed to be interactive and engaging. 

We recommend that you work through all lessons in the order they are presented as our research evaluated the impact of the project based on following the full programme, but you can of course dip in and out and use sessions which are most important and timely for your students. 

Each lesson should last 50 minutes to 1 hour and includes a starter, main activity and closing activity.  All include a short video from an influencer to contextualise learning. 

If you have any feedback on the programme, please get in touch and let us know.  We hope you and your students enjoy the programme.

# Our Research  

This project was co-created by young people, teachers, influencers and academics.  The aim was to create a programme which could be delivered by educators to help young people to become critical consumers of online information. To test if our programme was effective in this we are currently running the project in three Glasgow schools.   

Young people will complete questionnaires exploring their ability and confidence in recognising fake news, the steps they take before believing and sharing information online and their conspiracy beliefs.  They will then participate in our 6 week programme.  They will complete the questionnaire again straight after they complete the programme and again six weeks after the programme finishes. This will allow us to see if our programme is effective both in the short and longer term.
