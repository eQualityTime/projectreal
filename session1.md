# Session 1: Fake News

The materials for the session can be found on the PowerPoint (“Fake News”). The PowerPoint has notes which outline the timings and other information which might be useful.  This session should take around 50-60 minutes. You do not need any equipment for this session except a projector.  The session is based on small group work/paired work.
The aims of this session are to teach students:
1.	What fake news is
2.	How to use the SHARE checklist.

## Resources
* [The lesson slides]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/lessons/1_Fake_News.pptx)

## Notes
*	The session starts with a welcome video from the Project Real team to explain the project (around 5 minutes).  
*	The first starter activity is a pair or small group discussion on fake news (around 5 minutes).
*	The second starter activity is a pair or small group discussion and written task, where students are asked to note how they know if news is real or fake and what they do about it if news is fake (15 minutes).
*	We then include a slide on the SHARE guidelines. You can explain these yourself, but we also provide a video with Dr Yvonne Skipper which discusses how to use them to spot fake news (5 minutes).
*	The main activity involves showing some examples of news and asking students in small groups to use the SHARE checklist.  Please show each one and give students time to discuss. We have provided 10 examples, you can choose a ‘quick fire’ discussion of all of them, or select a few to discuss in detail. Whether the examples are true or false is included in the notes section. Please encourage students to use the SHARE guidelines (Source, Heading, Accuracy, Retouched and Errors) in their discussions (20 minutes).
*	The final activity is a short discussion about the main activity (5 minutes) you can skip this if you do not have time.  There is a final slide on how they can use this information in their other lessons.
