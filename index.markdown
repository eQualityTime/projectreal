# Project Real 
Welcome to #Project Real.  This project has been co created by young people, teachers, influencers and academics. It aims to give young people the skills to be critical consumers of information they find online and to feel confident in their abilities to make good decisions based on this.

Here you'll find lesson plans and resources six hour-long sessions, each focussed on the government SHARE guidelines and each covering a different element of fake news, e.g. fake photos, fake people and fake videos.  The lessons are designed for learners aged around 11-13.  


## Why? 
Fake news reaches more people and spreads more quickly than the truth (Science, 2018) and is believed around 75% of the time (Silveman & Singer-Vine, 2016), meaning millions of people may have been fooled by fake news (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017). It is vital to help people to develop skills to recognise fake news as they are our first line of defence against fake news. 

## How? 
The innate problem with teaching students to avoid fake news is that they, quite reasonably, don't trust that teachers or parents are experts in navigating the complex social relationships of their online lives.  

> Young people are less likely to trust information which comes from those in a position of power, but trust information from people they perceive to be like themselves (Bocian, et al, 2018). 

So who do they trust? They trust each other, and they trust the people they see are 'good at' social media. 

>  Many young people feel that their favourite Influencers understand them better than their friends do (O’Neil-Hart & Blumenstein, 2016). 

So to build these resources, we arranged for influencers to give a serious of talks and Q&A sessions to groups of students and worked with those students to co-create lesson plans (which included asking the influencers to record short snippets on their area of expertise). As a result, the resources below are informed by expert opinion and also set at an ideal level for the students to appreciate and understand.

## Does it work? 
We gave the resources to three schools in Glasgow for the PSHE lessons and tested the students before and after (N=85).  Here's the results: 

* Young people felt more confident at knowing what fake news is after the intervention (M = 5.53, SD = 1.03) than before (M = 5.26, SD = 1.34), t(65) = -2.01, p = .049.
* Young people also felt more confident at identifying fake news (M = 5.42, SD = 1.00) than before the intervention (M = 4.66, SD = 1.77), t(64) = -5.58, p < .001.
* Young people felt that after the intervention (M = 5.32, SD = 0.96), they were more likely to spot a fake news story from real news than before (M = 4.71, SD = 1.17), t(65) = -4.39, p <.001.
* After the intervention, young people reported they would use more fact checking behaviours to determine whether an online news story is true (e.g., reading beyond the headline, look at how professional the story looks; M = 3.48, SD = 1.65) than before (M = 2.85, SD = 1.73), t(47) = 2.18, p = .034.

### Comments from teachers
> ‘the videos from the Instagram influencers. That was really good to relate it to the real world, um especially when this is becoming a quite an aspiring career to get into.’ 

> ‘I think having pupils involved is the way forward. Yeah. It's really, it's designing it with them.’

> ‘it's interesting, because young people just think that they know, everything, but then the examples that you had given, it was quite kind of thought provoking and things like that. So it was it was really useful.’ 

> ‘I genuinely think that when I could see lightbulb moments when we were chatting about things, and they were understanding it at the time.’ 

> ‘I've already had staff saying they thought it should be delivered to all year groups. Someone else who didn't deliver it, but heard about it said has said, asked me if we could use it again next year’

## Our funder
We are funded by [Not Equal](https://not-equal.tech/).  Not-Equal is a UKRI funded network, NetworkPlus, that aims to foster new collaborations in order to create the conditions for digital technology to support social justice, and develop a path for inclusive digital innovation and a fairer future for all in and through the digital economy.

## Our Programme 
Each lesson pack includes: 
* A set of slides presenting the activities we  designed to help young people to recognise and challenge fake news.  
* A short teacher guide with rough timings and materials you may need for the session.  

We recommend that you work through all lessons in the order they are presented as our research evaluated the impact of the project based on following the full programme, but you can of course dip in and out and use sessions which are most important and timely for your students.
Each lesson should last 50 minutes to 1 hour and includes a starter, main activity and closing activity.  All include a short video from an influencer to contextualise learning.

### Session 1- Fake News
This session will introduce young people to the topic of fake news and help them develop the skills to recognise fake news.

### Session 2- Fake Photos
This session will help young people develop skills in recognising when photos may have been edited, reflect on why people might edit photos and the impact this can have.

### Session 5- Fake Videos 
In this session we will explore fake videos, giving young people the tools to learn what to look for on videos which may not be real and the impact this can have.

### Session 6- Keeping it Real
In this session, young people will bring together their knowledge from all the different sessions to create resources to help teach people younger than them about fake news.

## Our Research  
This project was co-created by young people, teachers, influencers and academics.  The aim was to create a programme which could be delivered by educators to help young people to become critical consumers of online information. To test if our programme was effective in this we are currently running the project in three Glasgow schools.   

Young people will complete questionnaires exploring their ability and confidence in recognising fake news, the steps they take before believing and sharing information online and their conspiracy beliefs.  They will then participate in our 6 week programme.  They will complete the questionnaire again straight after they complete the programme and again six weeks after the programme finishes. This will allow us to see if our programme is effective both in the short and longer term.
