# Project Real 
#ProjectReal has been co created by young people, teachers, influencers and academics. It aims to give young people the skills to combat misinformation online. 

This site contains session plans and resources for six sessions, each focussed on the government SHARE guidelines and covering a different element of online misinformation.  These sessions have been designed to be delivered in schools and youth group settings  but may also be of interest to families.

## Why? 
Fake news reaches more people and spreads more quickly than the truth (Science, 2018) and is believed around 75% of the time (Silveman & Singer-Vine, 2016), meaning millions of people may have been fooled by fake news (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017). It is vital to help people to develop skills to recognise fake news as they are our first line of defence against fake news. 

## How? 
The innate problem with teaching students to avoid fake news is that they, quite reasonably, don't trust that teachers or parents are experts in navigating the complex social relationships of their online lives.  

> Young people are less likely to trust information which comes from those in a position of power, but trust information from people they perceive to be like themselves (Bocian, et al, 2018). 

So who do they trust? They trust each other, and they trust the people they see are 'good at' social media. 

>  Many young people feel that their favourite Influencers understand them better than their friends do (O’Neil-Hart & Blumenstein, 2016). 

So to build these resources, we arranged for influencers to give a series of talks and Q&A sessions to groups of students and worked with those students to co-create session plans (which included asking the influencers to record short snippets on their area of expertise). As a result, the resources below are informed by expert opinion and also set at an ideal level for the students to appreciate and understand.

## How did it go? 


### Comments from teachers
> ‘the videos from the Instagram influencers. That was really good to relate it to the real world, especially when this is becoming a quite an aspiring career to get into.’ 

> ‘I think having pupils involved is the way forward. It's designing it with them.’

> ‘it's interesting, because young people just think that they know, everything, but then the examples that you had given, it was quite kind of thought provoking and things like that. So it was it was really useful.’ 

> ‘I genuinely think that when I could see lightbulb moments when we were chatting about things, and they were understanding it at the time.’ 

> ‘I've already had staff saying they thought it should be delivered to all year groups. Someone else who didn't deliver it, but heard about it, asked me if we could use it again next year’

### Comments from students

> ‘I think now we look more aware of how you can spot fake news. And like, it encourages me to like double check or do a lot of research into what I've just read.’

> ‘Project Real definitely made me more confident myself. Like I said before, I know what to do now. Like usually now, when I look at the news, I’ll like double check things to see if any other news, like website has wrote the same thing and like read beyond the headlines.’

> ‘I feel like I can like when I see it I’d be able to tell if it’s fake news or like fake picture easier than before.’

> ‘For me, I don’t really look at news that much either. But like, especially when I'm scrolling on social media, like, I tend to kind of look at things, especially Instagram, because I'm like, Oh, I wish I could take photos as perfect as that. And then I'm like, wait, but that isn't real though.’

## Our funder
We are funded by [Not Equal](https://not-equal.tech/).  Not-Equal is a UKRI funded network, NetworkPlus, that aims to foster new collaborations in order to create the conditions for digital technology to support social justice, and develop a path for inclusive digital innovation and a fairer future for all in and through the digital economy.

## Our Programme 
Each session pack includes: 
* A set of slides presenting the activities we  designed to help young people to recognise and challenge fake news.  
* A short teacher guide with rough timings and materials you may need for the session.  

We recommend that you work through all sessions in the order they are presented as our research evaluated the impact of the project based on following the full programme, but you can of course dip in and out and use sessions which are most important and timely for your students.
Each session should last 50 minutes to 1 hour and includes a starter, main activity and closing activity.  All include a short video from an influencer to contextualise learning.  The sessions are designed for learners aged around 11-13.  

### Sessions 
* [Session 1: Fake News](session1) This session will introduce young people to the topic of fake news and help them develop the skills to recognise fake news.
* [Session 2: Fake Photos](session2) This session will help young people develop skills in recognising when photos may have been edited, reflect on why people might edit photos and the impact this can have.
* [Session 3: Fake People](session3) This session will focus on fake news in social media.  This includes spotting fake accounts, fake news and staying safe online.
* [Session 4: Fake Stories (Conspiracies)](session4) This session will explore conspiracy theories, why people might believe them and how to spot them online.
* [Session 5: Fake Videos](session5) In this session we will explore fake videos, giving young people the tools to learn what to look for on videos which may not be real and the impact this can have. 
* [Session 6: Keeping it Real](session6) In this session, young people will bring together their knowledge from all the different sessions to create resources to help teach people younger than them about fake news.
